        <dt><span>Question 1:</span> When can I buy my ticket?</dt>
        <dd>We're not sure exactly when, but very soon.  Keep an eye on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/WhiskyWebConference">Facebook page</a> and
        <a href="http://www.twitter.com/whiskyweb">Twitter</a> feed for updates.</dd>
        
        <dt><span>Question 2:</span> Airth Castle? How do I get there?</dt>
        <dd>Don't worry, we'll be providing transport to and from the venue, as well as covering the cost of accommodation for the evening!</dd>

        <dt><span>Question 3:</span> What's the format of the conference?</dt>
        <dd>We'll be starting the main event around midday at Airth Castle, and at a similar time on day two.  So we'll be having two afternoons
        of talks, with time in the morning and evening to socialise with the other delegates and speakers.</dd>

        <dt><span>Question 4:</span> This sounds like great fun, how can I sponsor you?</dt>
        <dd>You can <a href="mailto:info@whiskyweb.co.uk">email us</a>, or make contact via Twitter or Facebook.</dd>

        <dt><span>Question 5:</span> The schedule looks a bit vague, when will we see more details?</dt>
        <dd>We're still in the process of arranging a schedule of great speakers.  We'll put up the details as soon as they're ready!</dd>

        <dt><span>Question 6:</span> What if I don't want to stay at Airth Castle?</dt>
        <dd>You're more than welcome to make your own arrangements to return to Edinburgh or elsewhere. We wanted to provide an original,
        residential experience, so the accommodation is included in the ticket price.  Unfortunately we can't make concessions for those who
        want to stay elsewhere.</dd>
