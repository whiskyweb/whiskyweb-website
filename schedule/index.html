		<p> This talk is a celebration of the letter F as regards to software
		formation. From his first feats in forming friction free software, Josh
		has been fanatically fighting the furious fight for first class
		software. This talk is a free flowing fantastic flurry of fulmination
		about being fearful of failure, focusing on the fixed, forcing feedback
		and much more… So consider yourself forewarned.</p>

		<span class="presenter">Rowan Merewood</span>
		<p>Clients need to know how much a project will cost. Waterfall
		development is always late and over-budget. Agile development is done
		when it's done. You're left with estimates that you know are too low
		and then you squeeze them anyway. It shouldn't be this way. We'll look
		at how this happens, early warning signs, ways out and ways of avoiding
		it in the first place.</p>

		obtaining current-location information. Some hints on storage and

		<span class="session">Essential Node.js For Web Developers</span>
		<span class="presenter">Mike Amundsen</span>
		<p>Been thinking of trying out Node.js but not sure where to start?
		This fast-paced session hits all the highlights; the key concepts and
		skills you'll need to easily and quickly build scalable Web apps.</p>

		<p>Unlike some introductions that spend time explaining event loops and
		web sockets, this session start with a typical "Hello, Node" demo and
		quickly moves to short, fully-functional apps that show how to deal
		with static files, POST forms, mashups from other servers, file
		manipulation, data-handling, and even supporting HTTP
		Authentication.</p>

		<p>If you need to get up-to-speed on Node.js really fast, or just want
		to get a great introduction to coding this powerful Web server, this
		talk is for you.</p>

		<span class="presenter">Sebastian Marek</span>
		<p>Software engineering is not an easy profession. You have to
		constantly learn new things to improve your coding skills and make sure
		you produce better and cleaner code over time. It's not difficult, but
		you have to be aware of a few basic principles. With them in mind you
		will feel a better engineer and will gain respect from your fellow
		engineers. And the Lord said: "Thou shall always remember to write unit
		tests - no matter the deadline. Remember to keep the build green. Thou
		shall commit often and with meaningful messages (...)"</p>

		<span class="presenter">Brian Suda</span>
		<p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is estimated to produce 15 petabytes
		of data per year. This is difficult to store let alone understand!</p>

		<p>With connected devices quickly out numbering connected people, we
		are soon going to be swamped with data. Visualising the constant stream
		of information we are collecting so that it can be better understood is
		going to be a critical task.</p>

		<p>In this presentation, I'll walk you through a quick overview of some
		basic chart and graph design, then look at how easy it is to write some
		quick scripts in your favourite language to produce beautiful graphics.
		SVG is an under-rated technology, but it can be created
		programmatically and quickly to visualise data.</p>

		<span class="session">Lessons Learned From Testing Legacy Code</span>
		<span class="presenter">John Mertic</span>
		<p>Testing a PHP web application is relatively easy when it designed to
		be "testable", with none of those ugly things such as excessive use of
		the global scope, lots of procedural code, and plenty of nested
		objects. Rarely do we step into such a project, making it difficult for
		developers to start making strides in adding automated testing to
		legacy code like this. In this talk I'll explore strategies for getting
		testing going inside your project, drawing upon experiences of making
		legacy code more testable.</p>

		<span class="session">Mashing Up JavaScript</span>
		<span class="presenter">Bastian Hofmann</span>
		<p>Nowadays many modern web applications are solely relying on
		JavaScript to render their frontend and only provide an API endpoint at
		their backend, resulting in a much more fluent and
		desktop-application-like user experience. But if you want to create
		mashups, load data from many different places or include external
		widgets into your site, you are quickly running into boundaries because
		of browser and security restrictions. In this presentation I will talk
		about techniques, some older, some brand new which will help you
		to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>create rich JavaScript based Web Applications</li>
			<li>make API calls to external domains</li>
			<li>authenticate these calls through OAuth2 without compromising your secrets</li>
			<li>load external content and JavaScript widgets safely</li>
			<li>get real-time notifications from your backend with ActivityStrea.ms, PubsubHubbub, node.js and Websockets</li>
			<li>and use the browser to store the some of the user's data.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Additionally to talking about it, I'll show you how this works all
		together in a real JavaScript mashup based on the StatusNET micro
		blogging platform.</p>

		<span class="presenter">Thijs Feryn</span>
		<p>A lot of developers still develop their app as though it would be
		deployed on a single server. Things have changed, the internet has
		changed and in a lot of cases applications are getting deployed on
		multiple servers.</p>

		<p>Cloud is the term we often use to define this model, but
		unfortunately a lot of developers are unaware of this shift. This talk
		will point out the pitfalls and the tricks to be used.</p>

		<p>HTTPS, SSL, SSH, PGP are terms most people know that they are
		somehow related to encryption. But how does it work? During this talk
		you will find out why even the most complex encryption algorithms used
		today are based on very simple concepts. We will dive into the basics
		of public key encryption, how it works and together with some (simple)
		examples, give you some insight on encryption in general.</p>

		<p>The success of the Web as a system for information exchange that

		a very small set of key factors. But the interactions have thus far
		been driven by the smartest, most adaptable hypermedia consumers there
		are: human brains. Now it is time for machines to communicate in the
