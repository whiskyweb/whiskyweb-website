    Whisky Web II is a residential conference, and ticket prices will reflect this.  When you buy your ticket, you are
    buying a pass to two days packed with brilliant talks given by fantastic speakers; a night's stay at the beautiful
    Airth Castle; transport to and from the venue; lunch and refreshments and two social evenings that you won't forget!
    </p>
    <p class="large-text"> 
    Our early bird tickets will go on sale this Monday, 28th January.  Early bird tickets will cost as little as &pound;175.
    We can't offer everybody a single room for the night, so when you buy an early bird ticket you'll need to share a twin room
    with another delegate, but that's all part of the conference fun; this could prove especially handy if a group of you are  
    planning to come along form the same company!  We'll be in touch with early bird ticket holders closer
    to the event to find out if you have a preference for your room-buddy; someone you know might be coming along too!

    If this all sounds a little too much like camping, or if you'd simply prefer to have a room to yourself then don't worry,
    we'll manage the logistics and accommodate everyone to their satisfaction!
    There will be twin and double rooms available included in the price of a regular ticket.  Regular tickets will
    go on sale after the early bird tickets at the price points shown below.
