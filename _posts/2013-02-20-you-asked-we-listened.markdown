It's been almost a year since the inaugural Whisky Web conference, and the team have
been working tirelessly to bring you an event this year that we hope will exceed your
expectations.  Although a few members of the team are regular conference attendees, none
of us have experience at organising events like this.  But we do think we have a good idea
of what makes a memorable and engaging conference; and your feedback from the first
conference would suggest we got things right the first time around.

Our aim has always been to provide something a little different to that of a more
conventional conference.  But our vision won't always be shared by our delegates, and we
make mistakes, errors of judgements.

This year, we thought it might be rather fun to host a residential conference in a
castle... why not?!  We've priced our tickets commensurate with other conferences, but
thought we'd go the extra mile by including accommodation at Airth Castle in to the
bargain; that way, our delegates can enjoy the evening party without having to worry about
arranging transport to a hotel.  Unfortunately the venue only has a limited number of
rooms available, so some of the tickets are for shared accommodation for the night.

Unfortunately a number of people have expressed concern that this arrangement is unfairly
excluding those who live locally in Edinburgh, Glasgow and the surrounding areas.  We
understand that it might be seen that we are only catering to those who are travelling
from afar, and ignoring those who may want to attend the conference but not the party,
and instead make their own arrangements to travel home or to an alternative hotel.  This
certainly wasn't our intention.  Indeed, the same argument could be made wherever we chose
to host the conference, were we to insist on including accommodation in the ticket cost.

We're sorry if we've excluded you, we didn't mean to.  Our only intention was to organise
an everything-included residential experience.  We have however listened to your concerns,
and are offering a new ticket costing &pound;125 which will give you access to the
conference without accommodation.  This ticket includes travel to, and from Edinburgh on
the Friday and Saturday, and of course we'd be delighted if these ticket holders can make
it to the after-party, although understand that they may chose not to due to alternative
travel and accommodation arrangements.
