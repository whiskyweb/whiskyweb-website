        This time around, we'll be taking our delegates on a litle bit of an excursion.  The venue for the last conference was great,
        but we know we can do better.  And in 2013 we'll be hosting a residential conference experience at the stunning <a href="http://www.airthcastlehotel.com/">Airth Castle</a>,
        nestled in the beautiful surroundings of Stirlingshire.  We'll be packing in plenty of talks from
        top-notch speakers and some fun activities on the first day, followed by an after-party, then returning to Edinburgh for a second day of hacking and socialising.

    <h3 class="light">What the shark!?</h3>
    <p class="large-text">
        You may have noticed a few subtle references of a <em>shark</em> nature dotted around the site.  Those of you who were at the 
        last conference may get the reference!  For the benefit of those who don't, we had a <em>"...frickin' shark with laser beams..."</em>
        &endash; well not quite, but we certainly had a couple of radio-controlled airbourne sharks roaming the main hall!  We certainly hope
        they'll be kind enough to grace us with their presence this time around!
