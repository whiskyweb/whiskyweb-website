          <p>The inaugural Whisky Web conference kicks off in <strong>Edinburgh</strong> on the
          <strong>13th and 14th of April 2012</strong>. A web conference created for the web
          community, by the web community, Whisky Web will have something to
          offer everyone who works with the web, be they a designer, a
          developer or something in between.  This is an amazing opportunity to

          <h2>What is Whisky Web?</h2>
          <div class="inner what-is">
            <p>While there are a great many web-related conferences throughout the
            UK, few are held in Scotland.  In recent years we've seen The
            Highland Fling and the Turing Festival put Edinburgh on the
            conference map, and Whisky Web hopes to capitalize on their success
            in bringing more exciting and awesome talks to a new Scottish web
            conference.</p>

            <p>Whisky Web will cover a broad range of subject areas, with a key
            focus on what makes the web great.  We'll be language agnostic; we
            won't focus on a particular development paradigm, nor will we
            concentrate on front-end design over back-end coding.  We want to
            be inclusive, and while it's very difficult to be all things to all
            people, we hope to have a good shot at it!</p>

            <p>You don't need to like a dram of whisky, (but it might help!)
            and you don't need to know your haggis, neeps and tatties from your
            cock-a-leekie &ndash; if you care about the web and want to hear
            passionate speakers wax lyrical about topics close to their hearts,
            and yours, get a ticket and get to Scotland this Spring!</p>

studies of how we relate to these digital objects.<br />
