          <p>The inaugural Whisky Web conference kicks off in Edinburgh on the
          13th and 14th of April 2012.  A web conference created for the web
          community, by the web community; Whisky Web will have something to
          offer everyone who works with the web, be they a designer, a
          developer or something in between.  This is an amazing opportunity to
          get your geek on in Scotland's inspiring capital.</p>

          <h2>What is Whisky Web?</h2>
          <div class="inner what-is">
            While there are a great many web-related conferences throughout the
            UK, few are held in Scotland.  In recent years we've seen The
            Highland Fling and the Turing Festival put Edinburgh on the
            conference map, and Whisky Web hopes to capitalize on their success
            in bringing more exciting and awesome talks to a new Scottish web
            conference.</p>

            <p>Whisky Web will cover a broad range of subject areas, with a key
            focus on what makes the web great.  We'll be language agnostic; we
            won't focus on a particular development paradigm, nor will we
            concentrate on front-end design over back-end coding.  We want to
            be inclusive, and while it's very difficult to be all things to all
            people, we hope to have a good shot at it!</p>

            <p>You don't need to like a dram of whisky, (but it might help!)
            and you don't need to know your haggis, neeps and tatties from your
            cock-a-leekie &ndash; if you care about the web and want to hear
            passionate speakers wax lyrical about topics close to their hearts,
            and yours, get a ticket and get to Scotland this Spring!

          <h2>Check Out the Full Event Schedule</h2>
          <div class="inner schedule">
            <p>Spread over two days, Whisky Web will combine a more traditional
            two-track programme of talks the first day, with a
            <em>hackathon</em> event on day two.  But the fun doesn't begin
            there; the evening before the conference the organisers would like
            to invite the delegates to join them in Edinburgh's Brewdog bar for
            an informal opportunity to become better acquainted.</p>

            <p>The first day will open with our delegates being treated to a
            warm Scottish welcome as they are played into the venue by a
            traditional bagpiper.  There will be the usual opportunity to grab
            a coffee and a chat before we begin with the first keynote and the
            talks get underway.  As the evening draws in, the lovely folk from
            Bruichladdich will give a masterclass on Scotch Whisky to get the
            party started!</p>

            <p>Day two will see delegates rolling their sleeves up and getting
            their hands dirty in our hackathon event.</p>

              <p>Join Craig Johnstone (<a href="http://twitter.com/WhiskyCraig">@WhiskyCraig</a>) from
              Bruichladdich as he guides us through the history of Scotch Whisky
              from humble beginnings to modernization through the peaks and troughs
              of the 20th Century ending up in the multi billion pound industry we
              see today. Learn of Bruichladdich, the one company out there doing
              things differently and experience first hand the craftsmanship and
              passion that goes in to building the most exciting and independent of
