                We couldn't have hoped for a better <a href="/2012">inaugural event</a> and we're raising the bar even higher for this April.
                If you're interested in a mix of conventional conference talks and fun and entertaining activities to
                help you get to know the other delegates, then keep April 12th - April 13th free in your calendar!

        This time around, we'll be taking our delegates on a little bit of an excursion.  The venue for the <a href="/2012">last conference</a> was great,
        but we know we can do better.  And in 2013 we'll be hosting a residential conference experience at the stunning <a href="http://www.airthcastlehotel.com/">Airth Castle</a>,
        nestled in the beautiful surroundings of Stirlingshire.  We'll be packing in plenty of talks from
        top-notch speakers and some fun activities on the first day, followed by an after-party, then returning to Edinburgh for a second day of hacking and socialising.

        You may have noticed a few subtle references of a <em>shark</em> nature dotted around the site.  Those of you who were at the
        last conference may get the reference!  For the benefit of those who don't, we had a <em>"...frickin' shark with laser beams..."</em>
        &mdash; well not quite, but we certainly had a couple of radio-controlled airborne sharks roaming the main hall!  We certainly hope
        they'll be kind enough to grace us with their presence this time around!
