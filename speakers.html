        <h1>Linda Sandvik</h1>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>Linda is a interface developer, wannabe MacGyver and adventurer. She's a nomad but is currently living in Hackney (London) and learning UX design at Last.fm (she likes learning new things).</p>
            <p>She is a technology resident at Spike Island art gallery, and recently discovered tinkering with electronics. She has made stuff like a laser harp, burping trashcans and an arcade style cycling game with actual bicycles as the controllers. She is obsessed with facilitating creativity &amp; learning, and making interactive installations that bridges the physical and digital.</p>

        <h2>Making things better</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>How do we become better interface developers? How do we find better problems to solve?</p>
            <p>The most interesting work lies outside of your comfort zone. So how can you get there? This is a sort of crash course in stepping out of your comfort zone, trying new things, learning to learn and creating your own luck.</p>
            <p>How should we do research &amp; development? To be innovative, we must create a culture that tolerates failure. But who wants to fail? And certainly not admit to it. I want to share with you some of my failures. We're taught to do things the right way. But to discover something that other people haven't, one needs to do things the wrong way.</p>

        <h2>How Google Builds Webservices</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>We've been building web services for many years at Google, and over the years our approach to them has evolved. In this talk we will look at some of the lessons learned and how they are embodied in the latest generation of our API service, and why developer experience matters both outside and inside of a team. This talk should be helpful for anyone considering or developing web services for the wider development community.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Ross Tuck is a senior developer and team lead at Ibuildings in the Netherlands, despite being American. He's currently obsessed with hypermedia, CQRS and vector graphics but this tends to change quickly. Otherwise, he's usually trying to make time to read.</p>

        <h2>HTTP and Your Angry Dog</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>What is an etag, exactly? What's all that stuff in the Accept header? And what the heck does a Vary header do anyways?! Web developers use HTTP everyday but most of us don't know how to get the most out of it. This talk goes past memorizing status codes (although we'll see those too) and teaches how to get the most out of every request and response.</p>

        <h2>Surviving a Prime Time TV Commercial</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>Setting up an online shop is a relatively trivial task these days. Pick your application, adjust some templates, sign payment provider contracts, make sure your supply chain is in order, and launch.</p>
            <p>But once you decide to aim higher and start airing commercials, on TV, during prime time hours, then regular off-the-shelf software will not cope with the flood of incoming requests. That's when it is time to build something a little more durable, without a single point of failure, serving pages in under a hundred milliseconds, unfazed by extreme concurrency.</p>
            <p>This is a talk about lessons learned and missions accomplished.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Ade is a Senior Developer Advocate in Google's London office and works on the Google+ project.

        <h2>Identity, responsiveness and the future of the web</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>Devices like the Chromebook Pixel (which are hi-DPI, touch-sensitive but aren't phones or tablets) show us that the future of the web is too complex for a simplistic approach to responsiveness. It's not enough to think that media queries and a few screen width breakpoints suffice to make your site future-friendly.</p>
            <p>In this talk I'm going to propose that responsiveness requires us to take into account the entire context of the user. That means everything from device orientation to bandwidth to identity.</p>

        <h2>Anatomy of a responsive page load</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>With more people accessing the web on mobile devices over mobile networks, the performance of your responsive website is only becoming more important. Creating a site that appropriately loads the content and assets required to deliver a great user experience to the widest range of users is a task fraught with trade-offs and nuances. Using the Guardian's new mobile first responsive site as a case study, we'll look at how you get browsers to download content and show it on people's screens as quickly as possible.</p>

        <div class="abstract">
            <p>Several exciting new Web standards in the areas of magazine-style layouts and advanced graphical and special effects are working their way through the W3C . Implementations of these advanced features are already starting to show up in various mobile and desktop browsers. We'll discuss the state of these technologies, and show you how and where you can use them right now and what to expect in the near future.</p>

        <h2>Debugging HTTP</h2>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>In this world where we have moved beyond web pages and build ever-more asynchronous applications, often things that go wrong result in errors we can't see. This session will give a very technical overview of HTTP and how to inspect your application's communications, whether on the web or on a mobile device. Using Curl, Wireshark and Charles, we can quickly and painlessly identify where the problem exists, without spending a lot of time making changes to our application to identify a problem. Whether you're debugging a backend API, an ajax request or an unexpected timeout, these are the tools you will want to have at hand.</p>
