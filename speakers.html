        <h1>Linda Sandvik</h1>
        <img class="hidden-phone" src='img/lsandvik.jpg' alt='Linda Sandvik' />
        <p>Linda is a interface developer, wannabe MacGyver and adventurer. She's a nomad but is currently living in Hackney (London) and learning UX design at Last.fm (she likes learning new things).</p>
        <p>She is a technology resident at Spike Island art gallery, and recently discovered tinkering with electronics. She has made stuff like a laser harp, burping trashcans and an arcade style cycling game with actual bicycles as the controllers. She is obsessed with facilitating creativity &amp; learning, and making interactive installations that bridges the physical and digital.</p>

        <h2>Making things better</h2>
        <p>How do we become better interface developers? How do we find better problems to solve?</p>
        <p>The most interesting work lies outside of your comfort zone. So how can you get there? This is a sort of crash course in stepping out of your comfort zone, trying new things, learning to learn and creating your own luck.</p>
        <p>How should we do research &amp; development? To be innovative, we must create a culture that tolerates failure. But who wants to fail? And certainly not admit to it. I want to share with you some of my failures. We're taught to do things the right way. But to discover something that other people haven't, one needs to do things the wrong way.</p>

        <h2>How Google Builds Webservices</h2>
        <p>We've been building web services for many years at Google, and over the years our approach to them has evolved. In this talk we will look at some of the lessons learned and how they are embodied in the latest generation of our API service, and why developer experience matters both outside and inside of a team. This talk should be helpful for anyone considering or developing web services for the wider development community.</p>

        <p>Ross Tuck is a senior developer and team lead at Ibuildings in the Netherlands, despite being American. He's currently obsessed with hypermedia, CQRS and vector graphics but this tends to change quickly. Otherwise, he's usually trying to make time to read.</p>

        <h2>HTTP and Your Angry Dog</h2>
        <p>What is an etag, exactly? What's all that stuff in the Accept header? And what the heck does a Vary header do anyways?! Web developers use HTTP everyday but most of us don't know how to get the most out of it. This talk goes past memorizing status codes (although we'll see those too) and teaches how to get the most out of every request and response.</p>
